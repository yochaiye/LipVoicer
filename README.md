## Demo Page
The [demo page](https://lipvoicer.github.io/) includes many sample videos and comparisons to other baselines.

## Introduction
Official implementation of LipVoicer, a lip-to-speech method. Given a silent video, we first predict the spoken text using a pre-trained lip-reading network. We then condition a diffusion model on the video and use the extracted text through a classifier-guidance mechanism where a pre-trained ASR serves as the classifier. LipVoicer outperforms multiple lip-to-speech baselines on LRS2 and LRS3, which are in-the-wild datasets with hundreds of unique speakers in their test set and an unrestricted vocabulary.

The lip reading network used in LipVoicer is taken from the [Visual Speech Recognition for Multiple Languages](https://github.com/mpc001/Visual_Speech_Recognition_for_Multiple_Languages) repository.
The ASR system is adapted from [Audio-Visual Efficient Conformer for Robust Speech Recognition](https://github.com/burchim/AVEC/tree/master).

## Benchmarks Test Audio Signals Generated by LipVoicer
We provide the audio generated by LipVoicer for the test videos of LRS2 and LRS3. They were used to compute the metrics in the paper, and therefore it will hopefully facilitate future comparisons.

The links are given below:
* [LRS2](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15BgeaU-j4B-o9WfP-d-BSnnjslAxOHkt)
* [LRS3](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1y4O3grI7uwnjN5GIoydrGhyvK63ptLSy)

## Pretrained Models
We provide pretrained checkpoints for LipVoicer so you can kick-start generating speech for silent videos. You can download checkpoint for the following models

* MelGen trained on LRS2/LRS3
* ASR finetuned for LipVoicer on LRS2/LRS3
* Language model for the ASR (provided by [Audio-Visual Efficient Conformer for Robust Speech Recognition](https://github.com/burchim/AVEC/tree/master))
* Lip-reading network and its language model (provided by [Visual Speech Recognition for Multiple Languages](https://github.com/mpc001/Visual_Speech_Recognition_for_Multiple_Languages))
* HiFi-GAN trained on 16KHz audio signals. In the paper we used DiffWave as the vocoder, but since HiFi-GAN is faster it is used here as the vocoder.

The simplest and fastet way to download the models is to run
```
python download_checkpoints.py
```
which will download all the pretrained checkpoints and put them in the right place in the repository. 

Alternatively, you can download individual checkpoint from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1IdYw_jiKyfBdemiel6XD2rHkbIG12MbM)

## Inference
### In-the-Wild Videos
To generate a speech signal for your video, you first need to edit the following arguments in the hydra [config file](https://github.com/yochaiye/LipVoicer/blob/main/configs/config.yaml)

* `generate.ckpt_path`
* `generate.video_path`
* `generate.save_dir`

You can also play with the values of `w_video, w_asr, ast_start`. Then run the following command
```
python inference_real_video.py
```
which will also take care of converting the video fps rate to 25Hz if necessary, mouth cropping and lip-reading.

### Test Videos for LRS2/LRS3
If you wish to generate audio files for all of the test videos of LRS2/LRS3, first download the predicted lip-readings ([LRS2](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1T4ZFGvW9643844BaOnJyo78-KN83h8Yf), [LRS3](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sYs2MAmCF80GPK_kBieU2S5pOfJpcBei/view?usp=drive_link)), and then use the following
```
python inference_full_test_split.py generate.ckpt_path=<path_to_MelGen_ckpt>
                                    generate.save_dir=<save_dir> \
                                    generate.lipread_text_dir=<lipread_text_dir> \
                                    dataset.videos_dir=<videos_dir> \
                                    dataset.audios_dir=<audio_dir> \
                                    dataset.mouthrois_dir=<mouthrois_dir
```

## Training
For training LipVoicer on the benchmark datasets, please download [LRS2](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/lip_reading/lrs2.html) or [LRS3](https://mmai.io/datasets/lip_reading/). 

### Data Preparation
The purpose of the data preparation step is to compute the groundtruth mel-spectrograms of the benchmark videos and extract the lip region videos.
At the end of the process, you should have the following directory trees for LRS2 and LRS3:

```
├── LRS2                          
    │       └── [videos]               (contain the video in .mp4)
    │                └── [main]
    │                └── [pretrain]
    │       └── [audios]             (contain the audio files in .wav and .wav.spec)
    │                └── [main]
    │                └── [pretrain
    │       └── [mouth_rois]         (contain the mouth ROIs in .npz)
    │                └── [main]
    │                └── [pretrain]

├── LRS3                          
    │       └── [videos]               (contain the video in .mp4)
    │                └── [pretrain]
    │                └── [trainval]
    │                └── [test]
    │       └── [audios]             (contain the audio files in .wav and .wav.spec)
    │                └── [pretrain]
    │                └── [trainval]
    │                └── [test]
    │       └── [mouth_rois]         (contain the mouth ROIs in .npz)
    │                └── [pretrain]
    │                └── [trainval]
    │                └── [test]
```

To this end, perform the following steps inside the LipVoicer directory:
1. Extract the audio files from the videos (audio files will be saved in a WAV format)
```
python dataloaders/extract_audio_from_video.py --ds_dir <path_to_video_dir> \
                                               --split <trainval/test/...>  \
                                               --out_dir <output_directory>
```
The `wav` files will be saved to `output_directory/split`

2. Compute the log mel-spectrograms and save them
   ```
   python dataloaders/wav2mel.py dataset.audios_dir=<path_to_directory_with_extracted_wav_files>
   ```
   It will save the mel-spectrograms with extension `.wav.spec`.

3. Crop the mouth regions of the videos, convert to greyscale and save to `<mouthrois_dir>`. The easiest way is to
    1. Clone [Visual Speech Recognition for Multiple Languages](https://github.com/mpc001/Visual_Speech_Recognition_for_Multiple_Languages).
    2. Download the landmarks for LRS2/LRS3
    3. Copy `dataloader/extract_mouthcrops.py` from the LipVoicer repository and run it from the command line. It saves the greyscale mouthcrops as numpy arrays in `.npz` files.

### Train
1. Train MelGen
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python train_melgen.py train.save_dir=<save_dir> \
                                                dataset.videos_dir=<videos_path> \
                                                dataset.audios_dir=<audios_dir> \
                                                dataset.mouthrois_dir=<mouthrois_dir>
```
The progress of the training stage is monitored with TensorBoard.

2. Finetune the modified ASR, which now includes the diffusion time-step embedding.
